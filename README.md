<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](preview.png)

The project is hosted on Vercel. It took about a couple of hours to complete. I needed to familiarize myself with media queries again. I am so used to frameworks that I forget the fundamental information required for responsive web desgin. Grateful to TailwindCSS for speeding up the process but sometimes it's good to get back to basics.

### Built With

- Vanilla HTML and CSS

## Features

This site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build a 404 website.
